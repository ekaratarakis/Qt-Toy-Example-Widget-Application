# Qt-Toy-Example-Widget-Application
This is a toy example widget application using Qt and C++. The application is pretty straight forward since it will ask from the user to push one of the buttons provided in order to choose which programming language prefers the most. So given 4 choices (Java, C, C++ and Python) the user can push each of the 4 buttons respectively and see the outcome of that choice on the plain text. This is a great example on how to use Qt and C++ on designing a pretty simple but functional, in a common sence, application and learn how to insert and manipulate push buttons, change their styles, create a function to define all the necessary fucntionalities of the buttons and connect the button(s) with signals to the slot function. A running example is showing in the following pictures.
